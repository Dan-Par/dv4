		<h1>North America</h1>
		<p>LOS ANGELES: One of the most densely populated and diverse cities in the world, Los Angeles will be my first stop of my trip around the world. Not only is it close to South Pasadena, it has many landmarks that make California known for this bustling city. It has the Hollywood hills, it has the sky scraping Downtown area,and there are the Beverly Hills. Not only does it include one of the most populous areas, it includes many people who are celebrities. My specific place to visit will be here, at The Grove. This gilded open air mall is a part of my childhood memories,having spent so much time there during the weekends.

		<p>SAN FRANCISCO: A city known for the Golden Gate Bridge,is the home of many stops that are unknown to the world, but deserved to be known. The Fisherman's Wharf includes a ferry ride from Alcatraz, has a yearly display of sea lions, and one of the best clam chowder you will have ever tasted. Speaking of Alcatraz, it has been decommissioned to a museum, displaying the rows and rows of cells that held one of the Bay's most infamous criminals. Not only that, you can rent a bicycle ride to, through, and from the Golden Gate Bridge. If the weather is nice, it will be one of the most tiring but magical bicycle ride you will ever ride.

		<p>SPOKANE: Spokane is one of the few cities in the state of Washington. It was here that I was taken to the nearby state of Idaho to the Kootenai National Forest, in the Snowberry campground of Lake Pend Orielle. It was here that I caught my first fish and caught many more, sometimes in the span of 10 minutes in between each fish! We stayed there for around 3 days and had an immense amount of fun during the trip.(keep in mind that fishing here was cheating, The lake is known to have an over-populated fish problem.)

		<p>WASHINGTON D.C.: One of the most recent place I have visited, has one of the most beautiful places I have ever visited. There is the majestic Monticello, the grand Mount Vernon, and the serene Arlington Cemetery. Not only that there are many landmarks to commemorate the history of America. The is the Washington Memorial, there is the Lincoln Memorial, and there is the Jefferson Memorial. There are also museums that hold the pieces of history for all to see. There is the National Archives, where the Declaration of Independence is kept, there are the multiple Smithsonian Museums, and there is the White House, where the president lives. All in all, there will be many things you will see that you will wish you can remember forever.
